<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About My Website

I created this website as both a personal project to learn React and Node, as well as a way to display the personal and team projects I have worked on. Each of the projects helped hone my skills on a variety of software relevant to many areas of computer science, from front-end development to back-end development to servers and much more. With all of the knowledge and experience I have gained through these projects, I want to continue my career as a software developer, specifically on front-end, back-end, or full-stack development.

Here is a quick list of projects I have worked on and the languages/technologies I used:

* Multiplayer Tank Video Game - C#
* Online Coop Spreadsheet - C#, C++
* TA Application Website - C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* Rocket League Visualization Website - JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* StatisGoat (capstone project) - C#, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Python, Bootstrap
